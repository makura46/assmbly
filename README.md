# Student projects

Each year, my students in ITMO university can opt to make a project that is connected to system programming or system programming languages in general instead of passing the final test. Each project is coded by one student, who is is free to chose a topic of interest. The source code is always available on GitHub and  video demonstrations are mandatory. 

The videos are being uploaded to [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOLTncnm6jVkO0pcPoIoHFg). Soon all available videos for all years are going to be uploaded.
